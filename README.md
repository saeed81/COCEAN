# COCEAN is a tool for analysing NEMO ocean model suited for the operational oceanography. 

We do the analysis on the sea surface height and other important variables such as the temperature and the salinity. COCEAN uses C language both for the analysis and plotting data. For the latter, we use SVG format. The project is under development and the goal is to have a light and portable package with a minimum dependency on any external library as is common when things are done with python. C language helps us to achieve this gloal.
